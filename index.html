	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<div class="about-container">
		<div class="about-text">
			<p>I’m currently learning web development with a focus on backend engineering while building my first real project involving development, team coordination, marketing, and community building.</p>
			<p>I prefer learning through real projects rather than theory. Building for real users helps me understand both technology and product-building in practice.</p>
			<p>I enjoy planning, strategy, and turning creative ideas into structured projects. Problem-solving is what drives me to learn and build.</p>
			<p>Before starting a project, I ask whether it creates real value — that meaning guides the direction, strategy, and execution.</p>

			<p>A decentralized learning-exchange platform powered by community teaching.</p>

			EduProtocol is a skill-exchange learning platform where members teach sessions to earn tokens they can use to learn from others.
It enables value exchange through knowledge sharing and community participation.</p>
			<h4>Why it exists</h4>
			<p>The project was born from frustration with traditional education systems and a belief in meaningful, self-directed learning supported by community.</p>
